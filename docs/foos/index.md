# Foo

## Traditional Foo

Some tightpants developers are unaware that Foobar was adopted and changed from Fubar, or FUBAR. The terms foobar, or foo and others are used as metasyntactic variables and placeholder names in computer programming or computer-related documentation. They have been used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept.  

### Foo With Bar

Foo with bar is the expected form.   

### Foo Without Bar

Foo without bar is simply Fooey.
