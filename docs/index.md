## Mkdocs Material PWA

Welcome to Mkdocs Material PWA  

This is an example of how a PWA based on Mkdocs and Material theme deployed to [Zeit.co](https://zeit.co) can be done. I'll do my best to give you all the hints you need to get this off the ground yourself.  Further customization specific to your needs will need to be explored on your own, but this will be a good base to start from.  

## Reasons You Might Want to Use This    

* Serverless setup  
* Store and edit your content in Github
* Markdown content source stays portable to many other frameworks
* Material design, nothing to do but add content  
* PWA example built-in, install-able, with offline caching
* Deploy to Zeit.co for so much cache profit
* Deploy to Github pages easy like Sunday morning
* Local development server with one command
* No database

## Credits

* Some credit must go to [stavfx](https://github.com/stavfx) for encouraging me to check out PWA as possible solution for my idea, and for taking the time to listen to it.  
* Some inspiration was derived [Snickdx/pwadocs](https://github.com/Snickdx/pwadocs/) which didn't quite work for me but gave me a few hints on my way.
